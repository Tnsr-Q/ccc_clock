# Slide 1: The Problem
## Can Information Processing Affect Spacetime?

**Fundamental Question**: Does computational complexity create measurable gravitational effects?

**Current Status**:
- Theoretical frameworks exist (CCC theory, holographic principle)
- No experimental tests of information-spacetime coupling
- Optical clocks achieve unprecedented precision (10⁻¹⁸ fractional frequency)

**Opportunity**: Use co-located atomic clocks to detect information-induced time dilation

**Challenge**: Distinguish genuine spacetime effects from systematic errors

---

# Slide 2: The Idea
## Geometric Demodulation of Information Effects

**Core Insight**: Information processing creates operational curvature R_op = K̇/(Ṡ_e + Ṡ_loss)

**Detection Strategy**:
- Couple one clock to controlled complexity source
- Navigate parameter space in Θ-only loops
- Use ABBA protocol to cancel systematics
- Look for sign flip under geometric reversal

**Key Innovation**: Non-commuting geometry preserves CCC signal while rejecting environmental noise

---

# Slide 3: The Model
## Single Box Equation

```
(Δf/f)_demod = Γ_Θ * R_op * A_Σ + systematics
```

**Parameters**:
- **R_op**: Operational curvature (complexity/dissipation ratio)
- **Γ_Θ**: Geometric coupling in Θ-space
- **A_Σ**: Loop area in (ln r*, θ) coordinates (~10⁻⁶)

**Signature**: Perfect sign flip (ratio = -1.000) under loop reversal

**Falsifiability**: Specific geometric predictions distinguish from all known systematics

---

# Slide 4: Simulation Results
## Validated Parameter Sets

| Parameter Set | R_op | Detection Time | Complexity Rate |
|---------------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| A (Aggressive) | 9.5 | 0.8 hours | 300 MHz |
| B (Conservative) | 4.1×10⁻⁸ | 13.1 hours | 100 MHz |

**Bridge Analysis**: ε-continuation confirms theoretical predictions
- R* = 5.80, SE = 9.8×10⁻²
- Scaling exponent α = 0.22
- Linear convergence to commutator floor

# Slide 5: Protocol Design
## ABBA Demodulation Strategy

**Sequence**:
1. **A**: Forward Θ-loop with complexity source active
2. **B**: Reverse Θ-loop with complexity source active  
3. **B**: Reverse Θ-loop with complexity source active
4. **A**: Forward Θ-loop with complexity source active

**Result**: Systematics cancel, CCC signal doubles

**Modulation**: 0.3-0.8 Hz for optimal systematic rejection

**Witnesses**: Thermal, magnetic, optical power monitoring

# Slide 6: Experimental Requirements
## Hardware and Infrastructure

**Primary Systems**:
- Dual Sr lattice clocks (σ₀ ≤ 3×10⁻¹⁸/√τ)
- Quantum processor (100-300 qubits, MHz operation)
- Local coupling (≤1 pW dissipation near atoms)

**Environment**:
- Standard optical clock laboratory
- Active field compensation
- Temperature stabilization

**Timeline**: 6-month experimental campaign

---

# Slide 7: Risk Assessment
## Systematic Mitigation Strategies

**Low Risk (Mitigated)**:
- Stark/Zeeman shifts → Field compensation + witnesses
- Thermal fluctuations → Stabilization + monitoring
- Common-mode noise → ABBA rejection >40 dB

**Medium Risk (Manageable)**:
- Servo coupling → Bandwidth optimization
- Complexity source stability → Quantum error correction

**Key Advantage**: Geometric signature provides robust systematic rejection

---

# Slide 8: Sensitivity Analysis
## Detection Feasibility

**Current Clock Performance**: σ₀ = 3×10⁻¹⁸/√τ (state-of-art Sr clocks)

**Predicted Signal Strength**:
- Parameter Set A: >3σ detection in 0.8 hours
- Parameter Set B: >3σ detection in 13.1 hours

**Scaling**: Signal increases with complexity rate and loop area

**Validation**: All acceptance criteria met through simulation
